Positive :
- Using MVVM-C design pattern so its more solid princlpe, where view controller, view model, and coordinator had a spesific focus. View controller for the view, view model for the logic and fetching, coordinator for the app flow

Negatife :
- There is no test case, so the project is gonna be difficult to test for the errors
